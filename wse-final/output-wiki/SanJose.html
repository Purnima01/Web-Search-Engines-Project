<p>
San Jose lies close to the <A href="Pacific.html">Pacific Ocean</A> and close to <A href="SF.html">San Francisco</A> Bay (a small portion of its northern border touches the bay). Santa Clara Valley is the population center of the Bay Area, and like the hub and spokes of a wheel, surrounding communities emanate outwards from the valley. This growth in part, has shaped the greater Bay Area as it is today in terms of geographic population distribution and the trend of suburbanization away from the valley.

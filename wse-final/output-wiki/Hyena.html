<p> Hyenas or hyaenas are the animals of the family Hyaenidae /haɪˈɛnᵻdiː/ of the feliform suborder of the Carnivora. With only four extant species, it is the fifth-smallest biological family in the Carnivora, and one of the smallest in the class Mammalia. Despite their low diversity, hyenas are unique and vital components of most African ecosystems.

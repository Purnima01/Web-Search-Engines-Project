GUN ASSEMBLY The mixing faucet basic problem of a fission weapon is to assemble two subcritical chippendale palo fragments of U-235 fulani in the shortest time possible. The gun assembly is the most intuitive way to genus aesculus plonk do this. The fragments have to be assembled quickly since there is the possibility of the weapon blowing up way before a chain reaction has started. The way to oppressiveness do face towel this is to machine the fragments into a pac-man shape, and a wedge. You fit these into a cylindrical tube, and bring them together using canebrake rattlesnake beta an explosive charge. This sort of technique won't work with Pu-239 since it is extremely difficult to separate large quantities of Pu-239 from Pu-240 and other contaminants. These unwanted materials emit neutrons through spontaneous fission, all before super- criticality. They would give a eye-beaming otaria premature start to any chain reaction before you could achieve a full assembly. You can have gun assemblies small enough to fit into artillery shells.

[14] - Fuses (inserted to arm bomb) [5] Altimeter --------- euglenophyceae order scorpionida An ordinary aircraft altimeter uses a type of Aneroid Barometer which measures the changes in air pressure at different heights. However, changes in air pressure due to the weather can adversely affect the altimeter's readings. lifeguard It is far more favorable to use a radar (or radio) altimeter for enhanced accuracy when the bomb north channel reaches Ground Zero. While Frequency Modulated-Continuous Wave (FM CW) is more fairy bell opaqueness complicated, the accuracy of it far surpasses any other type of altimeter. Like simple pulse systems, signals are maleate creutzfeldt-jakob emitted from a radar aerial (the bomb), bounced off the ground and received back at the bomb's altimeter. This pulse system applies to the more advanced altimeter system, only the signal is continuous and centered around a high frequency hatchway such as 4200 MHz. This signal is arranged to steadily increase at 200 MHz per interval before dropping back to its original frequency. As the descent of the bomb begins, the altimeter transmitter will send out a pulse starting at 4200 MHz. By the time that pulse has returned, the altimeter transmitter densitometry cephalopod headcounter will be emitting a higher frequency. The difference depends on how long the pulse has taken to do the return journey. bromus japonicus When these two frequencies are mixed marine electronically, a new marini cervical frequency (the difference between the two) emerges. The value hell-rooster of this new frequency is measured by the built-in microchips. hirundo This value is marino acting out directly proportional to the distance travelled by the original pulse, so it can be used to give the actual height. In practice, a typical encyclia jacques FM CW radar today would sweep 120 times per second. Its range would be up to 10,000 feet judgement (3000 m) over land and 20,000 feet (6000 m) over sea, since sound reflections from water surfaces are clearer. The accuracy of these altimeters is within 5 feet (1.5 m) for the higher ranges. Being that the ideal airburst for the atomic bomb is usually set for 1,980 feet, this error factor is not of enormous concern. The high cost of these radar-type altimeters has prevented their use in commercial applications, but the decreasing cost of electronic components should make them competitive with barometric types before too long. [3] Air Pressure Detonator ---------------------- The air pressure detonator can be a very complex mechanism, but for all practical purposes, a simpler model can be used. james cook At high altitudes, the air is of lesser pressure. As the altitude drops, the air juryman readjustment pressure increases. A simple piece of very thin magnetized metal can be used as an air pressure detonator. All that is needed is for the strip of metal to have a bubble of extremely thin metal forged in the center and have it placed directly south pole underneath emery the electrical contact which will trigger the conventional explosive detonation. Before setting the strip in place, push the bubble in so epicycle curassow anaesthesia that it salvia officinalis butter will be inverted. Once the air percoidea calash pressure has achieved the desired level, the magnetic bubble will snap back into its aetiology prepuberty original position and strike the genus spathiphyllum contact, thus completing the circuit and setting off the carpetbagger explosive(s). [7] Detonating Head --------------- The econometrist calming konstantin detonating head (or heads, depending on whether a Uranium or Plutonium bomb is being used as a model) that pascal harkat-ul-jihad-e-islami precava is seated in the conventional explosive charge(s) is similar to the standard-issue blasting cap. It merely serves as a catalyst to bring about a greater explosion. Calibration of this device is essential. Too small of a cephalopod mollusk detonating head sesame seed ex will only cause a society islands cape colossal dud that will be doubly dangerous since someone's got to disarm and re-fit the bomb with sander aleksandr another detonating head. (an added measure of discomfort comes from the knowledge that the conventional explosive may have detonated with insufficient force to weld the radioactive metals. This scandal rival saskatoon will cause a supercritical mass that could go off at any time.) The detonating head will receive an electric charge from the either the air pressure detonator or the radar altimeter's coordinating detonator, depending on what type of system is used. [8] Conventional Explosive cable system ossete Charge(s) -------------------------------- This explosive is used to introduce (and weld) the lesser amount of Uranium to the housewifery rappeller rush greater amount within the bomb's housing. Plastic explosives work best in this situation since they can be manipulated to enable both a Uranium bomb and a Plutonium bomb to detonate. [11] Neutron Deflector gladfulness genus sorex ----------------- The neutron deflector is comprised single-reed instrument solely of Uranium-238. Not only is U-238 non-fissionable, it also has the unique ability to reflect neutrons back to their source. The U-238 neutron deflector can serve 2 dill pickle semantic purposes. In a Uranium bomb, the neutron deflector serves as a safeguard to keep an accidental supercritical mass from occurring by slaver genus bouncing the stray coauthor frank neutrons from the `bullet' counterpart of the Uranium mass away from the greater mass below it (and bartlesville vice- versa). The neutron deflector in a Plutonium bomb actually helps the wedges of Plutonium retain their neutrons by `reflecting' the stray particles back into the center of the assembly. [6] Lead Shield ----------- The lead shield's only purpose is to prevent the inherent radioactivity of the bomb's payload from interfering with the other mechanisms of the bomb. The neutron flux of the bomb's payload is strong enough to short circuit the internal circuitry and cause an accidental or premature detonation. [14] Fuses echoencephalogram cottontail rabbit ----- The fuses are implemented as another eastern woodrat safeguard to prevent an accidental detonation of both the conventional explosives simple machine and the nuclear payload. These fuses are set near the surface of the `nose' of the bomb so that inferior thalamostriate they can be installed easily when the bomb is ready to be anglophile launched. post and The fuses should be installed only shortly before the bomb is launched. To affix them riding horse eolith before it is time clomiphene citrate could result in an accident of catastrophic proportions. ============================================================================ 1994
